## Current notes (not fancyified yet)

- world is flat (yay pancake earth)
- character is paddling canoe down river
    - character starts 2 min from end of world (ahead)
    - river has obstacles
        - some give more time, some take away time
        - river also has fish which can give/take time if character goes fishing
    - character has to reach the end of the world at exact 2 min mark
        - special leaderboard
    - if character makes it across ahead edge of world (but wrong timing), gets on boring leaderboard
        - if character falls off back edge of world (wrong timing), instant death and no leaderboard
